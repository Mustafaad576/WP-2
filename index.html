            <h2>Workouts for Muscle Growth</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Strength Training</h3>
                <p>Strength training focuses on building muscle mass by lifting heavy weights with lower repetitions. Key exercises include squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. The goal is to progressively increase the weight lifted to promote strength and size gains.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Hypertrophy Workouts</h3>
                <p>Hypertrophy targets muscle growth through moderate weight and higher repetitions. Typical exercises involve multiple sets with 8-12 reps, focusing on muscle tension. Workouts include supersets and drop sets to maximize muscle breakdown and recovery.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Progressive Overload Techniques</h3>
                <p>Progressive overload is a technique where the intensity of exercises is gradually increased over time, either by adding weight, increasing reps, or changing tempo. This stimulates continuous muscle adaptation and growth, crucial for breaking through plateaus.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Recovery and Rest Days</h3>
                <p>Rest and recovery are as important as workout sessions. Muscles grow during rest periods, so itâ€™s vital to have recovery days between workouts. Proper sleep, hydration, and stretching routines are essential to prevent injury and optimize muscle repair.</p>
